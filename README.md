# SmartBrain Face Detection App

This fully responsive Web App uses a Machine Learning API to detect faces from any images.

The Web App is hosted on Railway [here.](https://face-recognition-react-frontend-production.up.railway.app/)

**_NOTE:_**  The application was previously deployed to Heroku but due to the Free Tier shutting down it was moved to Railway. Due to Railway App restrictions the deployed application will only be available for the first 20-21 days of the month.
